#SpotCrime-city

####Currently the `spotcrime` node module will allow you to fetch `json` of crimes in your area with latitude and longitude.  This `demo` wraps that functionality in a hapi server and retrieve the json with endpoints for city state.

##Getting started

```
git clone git@github.com:troy0820/spotcrime-city.git
npm i
npm start
```

##After you start the Hapi server, you can hit endpoints of city and state to see the local crime in your area.
